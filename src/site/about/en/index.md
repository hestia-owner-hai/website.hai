  Hestia.ai is a data expertise consultancy and training company based in
  Geneva, Switzerland.


  Here's our story in brief:\

  \

  When mathematician Paul-Olivier Dehaye discovered what Cambridge Analytica was doing with Facebook users' data to influence their votes, he did a hell of a job that led to the [Facebook-Cambridge Analytica affair](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump) and the making of the Netflix movie [The Great Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack).


  “Paul-Olivier Dehaye is now one of the world's leading experts on this issue”, [wrote Paris-Match](https://paris-match.ch/labecedaire-de-paul-olivier-dehaye/). Rather than selling his skills to the highest bidder, he convinced talented people to join him in the Hestia.ai adventure.


  Their goal: offer concrete solutions and intelligent support to companies understanding that trust is the new digital Eldorado.


  Their motto: User first. Privacy by design. No compromise.
philosophy: >-
  In Greek mythology, Hestia is the [goddess of the
  hearth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia). She takes care of the home, and
  makes sure the family feels at ease around the house fire to discuss events
  and ideas. This fire evokes also the fire stolen by Prometheus to be given to
  humankind. In our frame, this fire is data and data analysis, powerful tools
  that have escaped from our control. Hestia.ai puts that fire back as a center
  of our focus, so we can figure out its meaning together, and make sure it
  serves us rather than put us at risk. \

  \

  This interpretation is also evoked by [Stephen Fry in the Graham Norton Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KK2OBZIcRw).
