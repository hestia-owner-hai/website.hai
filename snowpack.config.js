// Snowpack configuration, integrated with Eleventy and Netlify
// https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/configuration
//
// Folder configuration of Snowpack is linked to the configuration
// of Eleventy and Netlify, and vice-versa; specifically:
//
//  * the `build/11ty` folder statically mounted at `/` must match
//    Eleventy `dir.output` setting;
//
//  * the `build/snowack` folder defined by the `buildOptions.out`
//    setting must match Netlify `build.publish` setting.
//
// HOW DO SNOWPACK AND 11TY COLLABORATE?
//
//   In dev and build modes, Eleventy will generate a static website
//   from the `src` folders into `build/11ty`; the later is watched
//   by Snowpack and statically mounted and served as-is at `/`.
//
//   In dev mode, any change to the source files would trigger a new
//   build by Eleventy. The resulting changes to `build/11ty` would
//   in turn be observed by Snowpack, which would trigger its own new
//   ES build, and statically serve the updated files of `build/11ty`.
//
// STATUS
//
//   Snowpack serves the results of the Eleventy build; and performs
//   an ES build of the Web Components in `/src/components/`, which
//   are mounted and available to HTML pages at base URL `/components/`.
//
